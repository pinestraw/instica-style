# Core Principles

Instica’s interface should feel calm, credible, and focused on helping sellers move inventory faster. Every design decision should reinforce these principles:

## 1. Calm retail credibility
- Neutral surfaces with confident single accent color.
- Avoid visual noise—every module must earn its place.

## 2. Inventory-first hierarchy
- Primary information order: **Title → Condition → Price → Status & Actions**.
- Keep data points aligned so sellers can scan dozens of SKUs quickly.

## 3. One-hand ergonomics
- Place primaries near the bottom of the screen.
- Maintain 44×44pt minimum targets for tap comfort.

## 4. Accessible by default
- WCAG AA minimum (aim for AAA on text under 16pt).
- Provide semantic cues beyond color (icons, labels, haptics).

## 5. Consistency over novelty
- Lean on shared tokens/components first.
- If a net-new pattern is required, add matching tokens so web + iOS stay aligned.

## 6. Platform awareness
- SwiftUI-ready tokens for iOS, CSS variables for web.
- Consider Dynamic Type, RTL, and Dark Mode from the first mock.
