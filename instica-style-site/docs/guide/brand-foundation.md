# 1. Brand Foundation

Instica exists to give sellers retail-grade control without retail overhead. This section anchors every visual and verbal decision.

## 1.1 Brand Overview
- **What Instica is:** an inventory operating system that unifies sourcing, cataloging, pricing, and fulfillment in one calm workspace.
- **Brand pillars:**
  1. **Trust:** data accuracy, dependable payouts, transparent automation.
  2. **Efficiency:** workflows tuned for one-hand entry, batch actions, and automation.
  3. **Mobility:** every surface adapts from iPhone to desktop so sellers can work anywhere.
  4. **Modern control:** analytics and AI helpers feel premium yet immediately useful.
- **Primary audience:** solo resellers, vintage shop owners, boutique retailers, and operations leads at fast-growing e-commerce brands.

## 1.2 Mission & Voice
- **Mission statement:** *Give every independent retailer the clarity and leverage of an enterprise ops stack.*
- **Personality:** confident, minimal, contemporary, quietly premium.
- **Tone:** short, crisp, and “friendly pro.” Avoid slang; prefer action verbs and sentence case.
- **Voice checklist:**
  - Use present tense and active voice.
  - Lead with benefit before feature.
  - Confirm empathy (“We keep payouts predictable…”) before instruction.

## 1.3 Logo & Usage
- **Primary logo:** `resources/assets/icons/instica-logo-october-24-transparent.png` for light backgrounds; use the grey variant for dark surfaces.
- **Clear space:** keep padding ≥ height of the capital “I” on all sides.
- **Incorrect usage:** never stretch, rotate, or add drop shadows; avoid placing on busy photography.
- **Monochrome version:** use `instica-logo-october-24-cream.png` when only a single color is available.
- **App icon grid:** 8pt safe area with 12pt rounded corners. Align the logomark vertically centered—see `resources/assets/icons/app-icon-grid.pdf` for reference.

## 1.4 Color Palette
- **Primary palette:** `color.brand`, `color.surface`, `color.textPrimary` from `tokens/colors.json`.
- **Secondary accents:** `color.brandSoft` plus success/warning/error tokens for feedback surfaces.
- **System colors:** map tokens to `UIColor`/`Color` assets so `Color.brand` adapts with light/dark automatically.
- **Accessibility:** maintain ≥ 4.5:1 contrast for text and 3:1 for icon-only controls. Use paired icons and labels for non-text indicators.
- See the [Color System](/guide/color-system) page for live swatches and dark-mode mappings.

## 1.5 Typography Overview
- **Hierarchy:** Display → H1 → H2 → H3 → Body → Caption → Micro.
- **Line height:** Keep 1.2× for headings, 1.5× for body/caption.
- **Tracking:** -1% on headings, -0.2pt on body text, 0 on captions/micro.
- **Weights:**
  - Display/H1/H2: Semibold
  - H3: Medium
  - Body: Regular, with Semibold for emphasis
  - Caption/Micro: Medium for clarity
