# Inspiration Gallery

These references come directly from the original `.style_inspiration` archive, which remains private inside the repo. Instead of embedding screenshots publicly, download the internal package and open the files locally when you need visual alignment.

## How to access the private boards
1. Clone this repo (or pull latest) and open `resources/style_inspiration/`.
2. Use the `screenshots/` directory for high-fidelity UI captures.
3. Open `particulars/` for callouts describing framing, gradients, and interaction principles.

> ⚠️ **Do not upload or hotlink these assets externally.** They contain unreleased product surfaces and should stay within Instica-owned tools.

## Suggested review prompts
- Inventory timelines: check gradient calmness, chip typography, and vertical rhythm.
- SKU grids: confirm 16px padding, 8px corner radius, and batch-select placement near the thumb zone.
- Actions & confirmations: keep primaries left-aligned, limit brand accent usage, and pair banners with copy tokens.
- Motion cues: reference the included Lottie exports for swipe, progress, and status transitions.

When building presentations, export from the `resources` folder directly so the latest assets stay versioned but never leave the private repo.
