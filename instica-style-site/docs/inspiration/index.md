# Inspiration Gallery

These references come directly from the original `.style_inspiration` archive. Use them during critiques to align on lighting, composition, and motion cues.

## Inventory moments
![Inventory timeline](/inspiration/timeline.png)
- Calm gradients to show time.
- Overlay chips use `type.micro`.

![SKU grid](/inspiration/sku-grid.png)
- Cards with 16px padding, 8px radius.
- Batch select bar pinned to bottom.

## Actions & confirmations
![Bulk publish](/inspiration/bulk-publish.png)
- Primary CTA left-aligned for thumb reach.
- Inline feedback banner shares success state.

![Payout confirmation](/inspiration/payout.png)
- Use brand accent sparingly—only confirmatory details.
- Data tables rely on `type.caption` headings.

## Motion cues
Embed Lottie or GIF loops showing:
- Swipe-to-archive with haptic hint.
- Progress rings that morph to checkmarks.
- Status chips that animate between `warning → success`.

Store the source assets in `/resources/style_inspiration/` for higher-fidelity exports.
